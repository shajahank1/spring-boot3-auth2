That's great to hear that you got it working and successfully obtained the authorization code! ðŸŽ‰

Next steps typically involve exchanging this authorization code for an access token, which you can then use to access protected resources.

## How to Exchange the Authorization Code for an Access Token
You can use a tool like Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client to exchange the authorization code for an access token.

Using cURL
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8089/oauth2/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -u "my-client:secret" \
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" \
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTH_CODE" \
  -d "redirect_uri=http://localhost:8089/authorized"
Replace YOUR_AUTH_CODE with the actual code you received.
my-client is your client_id, and secret is your client_secret.
Using Postman
Create a new POST request to http://localhost:8089/oauth2/token.
Set the Authorization type to Basic Auth and provide your client_id and client_secret.
Under the Body tab, select x-www-form-urlencoded and add the following parameters:
grant_type: authorization_code
code: The authorization code you received
redirect_uri: The redirect URI you used (e.g., http://localhost:8089/authorized)
After sending the request, you should receive an access token in the response.

Yes, you can run cURL commands directly in the Windows Terminal on Windows 11. Starting from Windows 10, cURL is available by default, so you don't need to install it separately.

How to Use cURL in Windows Terminal
Open Windows Terminal:

Press Windows + X and select Windows Terminal or Command Prompt.
Run the cURL Command: Use the following example to exchange your authorization code for an access token:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8089/oauth2/token" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" ^
  -u "my-client:secret" ^
  -d "grant_type=authorization_code" ^
  -d "code=YOUR_AUTH_CODE" ^
  -d "redirect_uri=http://localhost:8089/authorized"
Replace YOUR_AUTH_CODE with your actual authorization code.
Use ^ as a line continuation character in Windows Terminal if you want to split the command across multiple lines.
Important Notes:
Make sure your Spring Boot Authorization Server is running.
Ensure that my-client and secret match your registered OAuth2 client details.
You should see a JSON response containing the access token if everything is configured correctly. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
