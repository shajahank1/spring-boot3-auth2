## embedding the auth login page in our client app?
Embedding the authorization login page within your client application is generally not recommended for several reasons related to security, best practices, and user experience. Here’s a detailed explanation of why and what the alternatives are:

1. Security Concerns
Phishing Risks: If you embed the authorization login page (OAuth2 login) within an iframe or directly on your application's page, users might not be able to differentiate between the legitimate login page and a potentially malicious one. This increases the risk of phishing attacks.
Cross-Origin Restrictions: Modern browsers and security policies often block or restrict embedded login pages due to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) issues, especially when dealing with sensitive information such as login credentials. Most Identity Providers (IDPs) or OAuth servers will set HTTP headers like X-Frame-Options: DENY to prevent their login page from being embedded.
2. Loss of OAuth2 Security Benefits
Redirect Flow Security: The OAuth2 Authorization Code flow is designed to be secure by redirecting the user to the authorization server’s login page, ensuring that user credentials are handled only by the authorization server. By embedding the login page, you bypass this secure mechanism, introducing potential vulnerabilities.
3. Compatibility with PKCE and Latest OAuth2 Security Standards
When using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), the redirection process is critical for maintaining security. Embedding the login page in your application breaks this flow, potentially rendering PKCE ineffective or leading to compatibility issues.
4. Better Alternatives: Redirect to Authorization Server
Instead of embedding, the recommended approach is to redirect users to the authorization server’s login page when they need to authenticate. Here’s why this is the best practice:

Security: The authorization server handles authentication, meaning your application never has to deal with user credentials directly.
User Experience: The user is redirected to a familiar login interface, which is often branded and provides consistency across applications.
Compliance: OAuth2 and OpenID Connect standards are designed to work this way, ensuring compliance with security best practices.
5. Customizing the Authorization Server’s Login Page
Instead of embedding, you can customize the authorization server's login page to align with your brand’s look and feel. Many authorization servers, including self-hosted ones like the Spring Authorization Server, offer ways to:

Customize the Theme: Change colors, logos, and styles to match your application's branding.
Add Fields: Add custom fields, such as additional user input fields or captcha, directly on the login page of the authorization server.
Integrate Third-Party Authentication: Include social logins or integrate with other identity providers as needed.
6. Embedding in an Angular or SPA Application
If you need to provide a seamless experience within your Angular or Single Page Application (SPA):

Open the Authorization Page in a New Tab or Popup: This approach still maintains the integrity of the OAuth2 flow and keeps the user experience smooth. You can track the authorization process and capture the callback response when the user completes authentication.
Use the Authorization Code with PKCE Flow: This is the most secure way to implement OAuth2 in SPAs, and it doesn't require you to store client secrets.
Summary
Don’t embed the login page: It’s insecure, against OAuth2 best practices, and often blocked by modern security policies.
Redirect to the authorization server's login page: This ensures you maintain security, compliance, and a proper user experience.
Customize the authorization server’s login page: Most authorization servers allow customization, which can provide a branded experience without compromising security.
Additional Option: Using an Embedded Authentication Widget (Okta/Cognito)
Some identity providers offer embedded authentication widgets (e.g., Okta’s Sign-In Widget, AWS Cognito Hosted UI), which can be included directly in your app while still maintaining secure OAuth2 flows. However, these widgets are carefully designed to avoid the security pitfalls of traditional embedding and should only be used when provided by trusted providers.
