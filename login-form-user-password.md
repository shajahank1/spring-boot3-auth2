## default user name and password for form login

By default, Spring Boot automatically generates a username and password for form login when the application starts, but only if no user credentials have been explicitly defined in the security configuration.

Default Credentials
Username: "user"
Password: Spring Boot generates a random password at runtime and prints it in the console.
For example, after starting the application, you might see a log message like this:

```
Using generated security password: b1838cf6-736d-4a67-83e8-d989260de798
```
This password (b1838cf6-736d-4a67-83e8-d989260de798 in this example) will be different every time the application starts.

To Customize the Username and Password
If you want to set a custom username and password for form login, you can define it in your application.properties or application.yml file:

In application.properties:
properties
```
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=secret
```
In application.yml:
yaml
```
spring:
  security:
    user:
      name: admin
      password: secret
```
With this configuration, your username will be admin and your password will be secret, replacing the default credentials.

If Youâ€™re Using Custom User Details
If you set up custom user authentication (e.g., from a database), you can provide your own user credentials and won't rely on Spring's default user.
