## The field AuthorizationGrantType.PASSWORD is deprecated

The AuthorizationGrantType.PASSWORD has been deprecated because the Password Grant type is considered less secure and is no longer recommended by the OAuth2 standard. This grant type is being phased out in favor of more secure flows like Authorization Code with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) or Client Credentials.

What Should You Do Instead?
If your use case requires the password grant type, consider the following options:

Option 1: Use the Authorization Code Grant Type with PKCE (Recommended)
The Authorization Code grant type with PKCE is a more secure alternative and is suitable for user authentication scenarios where you want users to log in via a login page.

Option 2: Use the Client Credentials Grant Type
This grant type is suitable for server-to-server communication, where no user context is needed. If your application communicates with a service in a machine-to-machine manner, this is appropriate.

Updating Your Code to Avoid Deprecated Grant Types
If you still want to use the password grant type temporarily for legacy reasons, here's how you can update your code while acknowledging the deprecation. However, I strongly recommend migrating to a more secure flow as soon as possible.

Example Code Without the PASSWORD Grant Type
Here's how you can update your RegisteredClient configuration to exclude the deprecated PASSWORD grant type and focus on more secure flows like authorization_code and client_credentials:

```
@Bean
public RegisteredClientRepository registeredClientRepository(PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder) {
    RegisteredClient registeredClient = RegisteredClient.withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
            .clientId("messaging-client")
            .clientSecret(passwordEncoder.encode("secret")) // Ensure it's encoded
            .clientAuthenticationMethod(ClientAuthenticationMethod.CLIENT_SECRET_BASIC)
            .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.AUTHORIZATION_CODE) // Use authorization_code
            .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.CLIENT_CREDENTIALS) // Use client_credentials
            .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.REFRESH_TOKEN) // Include refresh_token
            .redirectUri("http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/messaging-client-oidc")
            .redirectUri("http://127.0.0.1:8080/authorized")
            .scope(OidcScopes.OPENID)
            .scope(OidcScopes.PROFILE)
            .scope("message.read")
            .scope("message.write")
            .clientSettings(ClientSettings.builder().requireAuthorizationConsent(true).build())
            .tokenSettings(TokenSettings.builder().accessTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofMinutes(30)).build())
            .build();

    return new InMemoryRegisteredClientRepository(registeredClient); // Or use JPA if configured
}
```
Key Differences and Advantages of Using Authorization Code with PKCE
More Secure: PKCE adds an extra layer of security by using dynamically generated secrets for authorization.
Better for Public Clients: PKCE is ideal for clients that cannot securely store a client_secret (e.g., mobile apps, SPAs).
Next Steps
Consider migrating to the authorization_code grant type with PKCE.
Avoid using the password grant type in new implementations, as itâ€™s deprecated and less secure.
