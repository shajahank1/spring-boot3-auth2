#  token expiry 
To configure the token expiry settings in Spring Authorization Server, you need to customize the RegisteredClient configurations to set the expiry times for access tokens, refresh tokens, and authorization codes.

Here's how you can configure the token expiry times:

1. Customize the RegisteredClient Configuration
You can configure the token expiry settings when you create and register a RegisteredClient. Here's an example:

java
Copy code
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.client.RegisteredClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.client.RegisteredClientRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.authorization.config.TokenSettings;
import java.time.Duration;

@Configuration
public class OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfig {

    @Bean
    public RegisteredClientRepository registeredClientRepository() {
        // Create a RegisteredClient
        RegisteredClient registeredClient = RegisteredClient.withId("your-client-id")
                .clientId("your-client")
                .clientSecret("{noop}your-secret") // {noop} to avoid encoding, use proper encoding in production
                .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.AUTHORIZATION_CODE)
                .authorizationGrantType(AuthorizationGrantType.REFRESH_TOKEN)
                .redirectUri("http://localhost:8080/authorized")
                .scope("read")
                .scope("write")
                .tokenSettings(tokenSettings()) // Set the token settings
                .build();

        return new InMemoryRegisteredClientRepository(registeredClient);
    }

    private TokenSettings tokenSettings() {
        return TokenSettings.builder()
                .accessTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofMinutes(15)) // Set access token expiry to 15 minutes
                .refreshTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofDays(30))   // Set refresh token expiry to 30 days
                .reuseRefreshTokens(true)                     // Allow reuse of refresh tokens
                .build();
    }
}
Explanation
accessTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofMinutes(15)): Configures the access token's lifetime. Here, it's set to 15 minutes.
refreshTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofDays(30)): Configures the refresh token's lifetime. Here, it's set to 30 days.
reuseRefreshTokens(true): Allows the refresh token to be reused. You can set it to false if you want a new refresh token to be issued each time it is used.
2. Register the RegisteredClient
If you're using a database to manage RegisteredClient entries, make sure that the token settings are stored correctly in your database table, and update them accordingly when creating or updating a RegisteredClient.

3. Apply the Configuration
Restart your authorization server after making these changes for them to take effect.

You can adjust Duration.ofMinutes(15) and Duration.ofDays(30) as per your requirements for different expiry times.

i am using table - REGISTERED_CLIENT

To configure token expiry in your Spring Authorization Server setup using the REGISTERED_CLIENT table, you can specify the values for access_token_validity and refresh_token_validity in seconds.

Hereâ€™s how you can set these values:

Setting the values in the REGISTERED_CLIENT table:

access_token_validity: Specifies the duration (in seconds) for which the access token remains valid.
refresh_token_validity: Specifies the duration (in seconds) for which the refresh token remains valid.
For example, if you want the access token to expire in 1 hour (3600 seconds) and the refresh token to expire in 7 days (604800 seconds), you would set these values in your REGISTERED_CLIENT table as follows:

sql
Copy code
UPDATE REGISTERED_CLIENT 
SET access_token_validity = 3600, 
    refresh_token_validity = 604800 
WHERE client_id = 'your-client-id';
Updating your client registration in your application configuration: If you are registering clients programmatically using Java, you can configure it as shown below:

java
Copy code
RegisteredClient registeredClient = RegisteredClient.withId(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
    .clientId("your-client-id")
    .clientSecret("your-client-secret")
    .tokenSettings(TokenSettings.builder()
        .accessTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofHours(1))
        .refreshTokenTimeToLive(Duration.ofDays(7))
        .build())
    // Other configurations
    .build();
By setting the values directly in your table or through your code, your tokens will expire according to the configured durations.


For configuring client settings in the REGISTERED_CLIENT table for Spring Authorization Server, you need to use JSON format for the client_settings column. Here is how you can define the common settings with the appropriate JSON keys:

Example JSON for client_settings
json
Copy code
{
    "require_proof_key": false,
    "require_authorization_consent": true
}
Explanation of the settings:
require_proof_key:

true: Indicates that the client must use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). Typically used for public clients (e.g., single-page applications, mobile apps).
false: No proof key is required. Suitable for confidential clients.
require_authorization_consent:

true: Users must always provide consent when authorizing the client, regardless of previously granted consents.
false: The consent screen will not be shown if consent has already been granted.
Ensure that you store this JSON in the client_settings column correctly, as this is how the Spring Authorization Server reads and interprets the client configuration settings.

what abt if i give both value false?

If you set both values to false in your client settings, it means the client will not require authorization consent for each login, and will also not require proof of possession. Here's what they mean:

require_authorization_consent: If false, the client will not need explicit consent from the user each time access is requested.
require_proof_key: If false, the client will not require proof of possession (e.g., a code challenge) when exchanging the authorization code for a token.
Depending on your security requirements, you should set these values appropriately. If you want the most secure setup, keep require_proof_key as true.


To check the validity and expiration of an access token in an OAuth2 authorization server, you typically have the following options:

1. Introspection Endpoint (Recommended)
If your OAuth2 server is set up correctly, it should provide an introspection endpoint, which allows you to check the status of a token (whether it's active, its expiration time, etc.).

You can make a POST request to the introspection endpoint like this:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/oauth2/introspect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -u "client_id:client_secret" \
  -d "token=your_access_token"
The response will include information such as whether the token is active and when it expires:

json
Copy code
{
  "active": true,
  "exp": 1633012825,
  "scope": "read write",
  "client_id": "my-client-id",
  "username": "user@example.com",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
The exp field provides the Unix timestamp indicating when the token will expire.

2. Decode the Token (For JWT Tokens)
If your access token is a JSON Web Token (JWT), you can decode it to check the expiration (exp) and issue (iat) times. You can use tools like jwt.io or libraries like jsonwebtoken in Node.js or jjwt in Java.

For example, you can decode a JWT using a JavaScript library:

javascript
Copy code
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const decodedToken = jwt.decode('your_access_token');

console.log('Expires at:', new Date(decodedToken.exp * 1000));
console.log('Issued at:', new Date(decodedToken.iat * 1000));
3. Check Directly in Your Database (If Applicable)
If you are storing tokens in a database (e.g., in the oauth2_authorization table), you can directly query the table to check the expires_at fields for access tokens, refresh tokens, etc.

For example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM oauth2_authorization WHERE access_token_value = 'your_access_token';
You can examine the access_token_expires_at column to determine the validity and expiration time.

By using any of these methods, you can verify whether a token is still valid and when it will expire.
