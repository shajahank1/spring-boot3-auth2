# Yes, you can create a unified login page where users can select the client/application from a dropdown or similar UI element. Here's how you can implement this approach:

Modify the Login Page: Customize your authorization server's login page to include a dropdown or list showing all registered clients/applications. You can retrieve this list from the REGISTERED_CLIENT table in your database.

Handle Client Selection: When the user selects a client/application, your login form should include this client ID in the form submission to the authorization endpoint.

Adjust Authentication Logic: In your custom authentication logic, handle the selected client/application along with the username and password to process the login request.

Redirect Logic: After a successful login, redirect the user to the appropriate redirect_uri associated with the selected client.

This approach allows you to have a single, unified login page while managing multiple clients/applications effectively in your OAuth2 server.
