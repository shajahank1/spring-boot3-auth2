# customize the default login form
Yes, you can customize the default login form of the Spring Authorization Server. Here are the options you have:

Customizing the Default Login Page:

You can override the default login page provided by Spring Security to add more fields, a captcha, or style changes.
Create a custom HTML login page and use Thymeleaf or any other template engine. Register it using SecurityConfigurerAdapter to point to your custom page.
Theme and Style Customization:

Use your CSS and JS files to customize the look and feel of the login page.
Modify the HTML to add additional elements, such as branding or extra fields.
Embedding in Your Angular Application:

If you want the login process to be part of your Angular app, you can create a custom login form in Angular.
Use the Authorization Code Flow to handle authentication. When users enter their credentials in your Angular form, send them to the authorization server endpoint using an HTTP POST request.
This approach allows you to control both the appearance and behavior of your login process within your Angular application. Let me know if you need further guidance or specific implementation details!

but if user enter credential in our own angular page # will it support latest version of auth2 server - like password/grant type is not supporting...?
also- it will be not secure  right?|

You're correct. Using the password grant type is considered less secure and is no longer recommended in the latest OAuth 2.1 standards. Directly handling user credentials in your Angular app would introduce security risks, as it could expose sensitive information like passwords.

Instead, you should consider using the Authorization Code grant type with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This method ensures that the user's credentials are only handled by the authorization server, and the Angular app receives an authorization code that it exchanges for tokens. This keeps your setup secure and adheres to best practices.
