# redirect-uri 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/login/oauth2/code/my-client with your redirect_uri.  how to make this redirect-uri ,  can i make it the controller in same auth-server?

Yes, you can configure the redirect_uri to point to a controller within the same authorization server application if that's what you need. This can be useful if you want to handle the redirection logic or if you're building a user-facing application that needs to process the authorization code.

Steps to Set Up a Custom Redirect URI in Your Authorization Server
Register the OAuth2 Client with your desired redirect_uri.
Create a Controller in your authorization server to handle the redirection.
Handle the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow in your controller.
Step 1: Register the OAuth2 Client with the Custom Redirect URI
Make sure your OAuth2 client is registered with the redirect_uri pointing to your desired controller endpoint. For example, let's say you want your redirect_uri to be http://localhost:8080/authorized.

SQL to Register the Client
```
INSERT INTO oauth2_registered_client (
    id, client_id, client_secret, client_id_issued_at, client_name,
    client_authentication_methods, authorization_grant_types, redirect_uris,
    scopes, client_settings, token_settings
) VALUES (
    '1', 'my-client', '{noop}secret', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 'My Client',
    'client_secret_basic', 'authorization_code,refresh_token',
    'http://localhost:8080/authorized',
    'message.read,message.write',
    '{"requireAuthorizationConsent":true}',
    '{"accessTokenTimeToLive":3600, "refreshTokenTimeToLive":86400}'
);
```
Step 2: Create a Controller to Handle the Redirect
Create a Spring Boot controller in your authorization server application that handles the redirection after the user is authenticated.

Example Controller
```
package om.gov.moh.spring_auth2_server.controller;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

@Controller
public class OAuth2RedirectController {

    @GetMapping("/authorized")
    public String handleRedirect(@RequestParam(name = "code") String authorizationCode) {
        // Here, you can handle the authorization code however you need to
        System.out.println("Received authorization code: " + authorizationCode);

        // You might want to process this authorization code further
        // For now, just display a confirmation page or log the code
        return "authorized"; // This returns an HTML view named 'authorized.html' (you can customize this)
    }
}
```
In this example:

The @GetMapping("/authorized") endpoint matches the redirect_uri you registered.
When the user is redirected to this endpoint with an authorization code, you can process the code as needed.
Step 3: Create a View (Optional)
If you want to display a success page, create an authorized.html file in src/main/resources/templates if you're using Thymeleaf as a template engine.

Example authorized.html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <title>Authorization Successful</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Authorization Successful!</h1>
    <p>You have successfully authorized the client application.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
How This Works
When the user completes the OAuth2 authorization flow, the Spring Authorization Server redirects them to the redirect_uri specified by your registered client (e.g., http://localhost:8080/authorized?code=AUTH_CODE).
The OAuth2RedirectController handles this request and can further process the authorizationCode.
Testing the Flow
Start Your Authorization Server.
Initiate the OAuth2 Authorization Request:
```
http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=my-client&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/authorized&scope=message.read
```
Login and Authorize the client.
You should be redirected to http://localhost:8080/authorized?code=AUTH_CODE, and the OAuth2RedirectController should handle this.
Summary
You can handle the redirect_uri within the same Spring Boot application by registering an endpoint (@Controller) that matches the redirect_uri.
This approach lets you control how the authorization code is handled, either by displaying a success message or further processing the authorization code.

# http://localhost:8080/authorized&scope=message.read this need to put the registed_client table in database?
Yes, you need to register your client with the redirect_uri and scope in the oauth2_registered_client table. This allows the Spring Authorization Server to recognize your OAuth2 client application and handle the authorization requests properly.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of how to ensure your client is correctly registered, along with an example SQL script to insert the necessary data.

Step-by-Step Process
Register the OAuth2 Client with the redirect_uri and desired scope in the oauth2_registered_client table.
The redirect_uri should exactly match the URI you intend to use (e.g., http://localhost:8080/authorized).
The scope defines what access levels or permissions the client is requesting.
Example SQL to Insert the Client Data
The following SQL example shows how to register your client in the oauth2_registered_client table:

SQL Script
```
INSERT INTO oauth2_registered_client (
    id, 
    client_id, 
    client_id_issued_at, 
    client_secret, 
    client_secret_expires_at, 
    client_name, 
    client_authentication_methods, 
    authorization_grant_types, 
    redirect_uris, 
    scopes, 
    client_settings, 
    token_settings
) VALUES (
    '1', -- Use a unique ID for the client
    'my-client', -- The client_id that your application will use
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, -- The timestamp when the client ID was issued
    '{noop}secret', -- The client secret (encoded or plaintext if using '{noop}')
    NULL, -- The client secret expiration (NULL if it doesn't expire)
    'My Client Application', -- A friendly name for your client
    'client_secret_basic', -- The authentication method (e.g., client_secret_basic)
    'authorization_code,refresh_token', -- The grant types supported
    'http://localhost:8080/authorized', -- The redirect URI for the client
    'message.read,message.write', -- Scopes that the client is allowed to request
    '{"requireAuthorizationConsent":true}', -- Client settings (JSON structure)
    '{"accessTokenTimeToLive":3600, "refreshTokenTimeToLive":86400}' -- Token settings (JSON structure)
);
```
Explanation of the Fields
id: A unique ID for your registered client (e.g., '1').
client_id: The ID your client application will use (e.g., 'my-client').
client_secret: The secret your client will use for authentication (e.g., {noop}secret). The {noop} prefix means it's stored in plaintext for simplicity.
authorization_grant_types: The grant types your client supports, such as authorization_code and refresh_token.
redirect_uris: The redirect_uri that your authorization server will redirect to after authorization (e.g., http://localhost:8080/authorized).
scopes: The allowed scopes for this client (e.g., message.read,message.write).
client_settings: JSON settings to configure client-specific properties.
token_settings: JSON settings to configure token properties like expiry times.
Make Sure Your redirect_uri Matches Exactly
The redirect_uri you use in your client registration must match the redirect URI specified in your authorization request. For example, if you register http://localhost:8080/authorized, you must use this exact value when you initiate the authorization flow.

Initiating the Authorization Flow
When you start the OAuth2 authorization process, you might use a URL like:

```
http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=my-client&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/authorized&scope=message.read
```
client_id: Matches the client_id in the oauth2_registered_client table (my-client in this example).
redirect_uri: Must exactly match what you registered (http://localhost:8080/authorized).
scope: One or more scopes that are registered for this client (message.read in this example).
Verifying the Setup
Start your Spring Authorization Server and use the URL above to test the flow.
Ensure you are redirected to http://localhost:8080/authorized with an authorization code.
Summary
Yes, you must register the client with the redirect_uri and scopes in the oauth2_registered_client table.
Ensure the redirect_uri in your request matches the entry in the database.
The OAuth2 authorization flow will work correctly once the client is registered.


http://localhost:8080/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=my-client&redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/authorized&scope=message.read
in the above one redirect_uri is really required as i have configured in database table level .

Yes, the redirect_uri is required in the request, even if you've configured it at the database level. This ensures that the authorization request matches one of the pre-registered redirect URIs for security reasons. The authorization server validates that the redirect_uri parameter in the request is a match with the URI(s) stored in your database to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.






You said:
client_id required ?
ChatGPT said:

Yes, the client_id is required in the authorization request. The client_id uniquely identifies the client (application) making the request to the authorization server. It ensures that the authorization server knows which client is requesting authorization and allows the server to validate the request against the registered client details (e.g., allowed redirect URIs, scopes, etc.).

Without the client_id, the authorization server cannot identify the client making the request and will reject the request as invalid.
